<h2> 1. Data Analytics </h2>
Firstly, an analysis of the raw data was carried out in Excel, where I analyzed the ideal combinations of data for the formation of the dashboard, understanding the need for the objective, which was to understand the total and monthly revenue of each shopping mall, observing which periods had increases and decreases in sales and profits.
<h2> 2. Data Manipulation </h2>
After analyzing the data, it was filtered to facilitate the creation of the dashboard.
<h2> 3. Data Modeling </h2>
In this step, the information obtained in the previous steps was used, creating the necessary measurements in the PowerBI environment to facilitate the creation of graphs, cards and filters.
<h2> 4. Dashboard Creation and Styling </h2>
Finally, the dashboard fields were created and styled, a step made easier by those carried out previously.
<h1> Final Result</h1>
